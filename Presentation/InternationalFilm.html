            <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" class="center-text">This film begins with a small ship of soldiers washing up to shore in japan where they recieved large wounds. They couldn't
                identify the source so they sent another small ship of men to discover what was happening. As more men washed up to shore it became clear that there was a larger
                threat. There was a ceremony performed to keep the threat at bay and it worked for that night. After trial and error and
                on going research, Dr Yamane believed Godzilla was a product of the atomic bombs that were dropped in Hiroshima. They knew Godzilla would soon arive so they set up
                an electric fence along the costal shore along with military infantry to stop Godzilla from passing. Godzilla made his way through the city as he destroyed almost everything
                in his path. It took a missiles from a fighter jet to finally sent Godzilla back to water. At this point many people were injured and buildings were destroyed. The japanese
                had to retaliate and Dr. Daisuke Serizawa had just the answer. He invented an weapon that reduces surrounding oxygen particles causing any form of life to asphyxiate.
                Dr. Daisuke Serizawa and Hideto Ogata go down deep into the water to kill Godzilla and to guarantee his death Serizawa sacrificed himself to kill the giant mutated lizard. </p>
